# ViBEx

This tool works as a visualizer for different binarizations of
time-series gene expressions. Time-series data must be in .csv
format to properly upload to the application. The .csv must only have a matrix of gene expressions (no column names or row names). 

## TO RUN LOCALLY:

- Have Python3 installed
- Install requirements with:
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
- Go to the folder "src" with the code and run:
```
python app.py
```
- Go to the local address stated on the terminal on your
	browser of choice
- Use CTRL + C to shut down the local server once finished

## Prepared dataset
- Folder "datasets" has a "matrix.csv" prepared to try the application. In addition inside "datasets/rules" there is a "rule.csv" file to draw Boolean Network based on these boolean functions. 

## HOW TO USE

1. Click on **UPLOAD GENE EXPRESSION FILE** and upload a time series dataset in CSV format
2. Select individual genes by clicking on the checkboxes. Deselect by clicking the checkbox again
  - Select all genes by clicking **SELECT ALL**
  - Deselect all selections by clicking **DESELECT ALL**
3. Click on the *Select binarization method* dropdown to select a threshold algorithm
  - Multiple can be selected at once
  - Click on **SELECT ALL** to select all available algorithms
  - Click on **DOWNLOAD CSV** to obtain a CSV file of the threshold for each gene calculated by
	each selected algorithm

### BINARIZATION TAB

 - Displays binarization of a gene from each algorithm's thresholds and elected states
 - Click on *Select gene to visualize and binarize* dropdown to select another gene
 - Selected gene will be used in the next three tabs

### DISPLACEMENT TAB

1. Thresholds Tab
 - Displays a rough line graph of the gene with each threshold displayed
 
2. Displacement Tab
 - Displays threshold displacement by each selected threshold method

### STATISTICS TAB
- Shows statistical data for selected gene

### NETWORK TAB

1. Networks Tab: Displays a possible network generated by the binarization of each selected threshold method
2. Network State Table Tab: Displays a table of states with binarizations generated by the threshold of each algorithm
3. Upload Transition Tab: Upload csv file with transition rules to plot Boolean Network. File needs to have two columns: Gene (Name of gene), and Rule (corresponding transition rule)
