# ViBEx

This tool works as a visualizer for different binarizations of
time-series gene expressions. Time-series data must be in .csv
format to properly upload to the application.


## TO RUN LOCALLY:

- Have Python3 installed
- Install requirements with:
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
- Go to the folder with the code and run:
```
python app.py
```
- Go to the local address stated on the terminal on your
	browser of choice
- Use CTRL + C to shut down the local server once finished


## HOW TO USE

1. Click on **UPLOAD GENE EXPRESSION FILE** and upload a time series dataset in CSV format
2. Select individual genes by clicking on the checkboxes. Deselect by clicking the checkbox again
  - Select all genes by clicking **SELECT ALL**
  - Deselect all selections by clicking **DESELECT ALL**
3. Click on the *Select binarization method* dropdown to select a threshold algorithm
  - Multiple can be selected at once
  - Click on **SELECT ALL** to select all available algorithms
  - Click on **DOWNLOAD CSV** to obtain a CSV file of the threshold for each gene calculated by
	each selected algorithm

### BINARIZATION TAB

 - Displays binarization of a gene from each algorithm's tresholds
 - Click on *Select gene to visulize and binarize* dropdown to select another gene
 - Type in number to find a specific gene when many are selected
 - Selected gene will be used in the next two tabs

### INTERPOLATION TAB

1. Left display
 - Click on *Select number of interpolations* to interpolate points between existing points with a cubic spline estimate
 - Graph will update according to selected interpolations
 - Voting table displays binarization according to each algorithm's threshold
 - Voting table threshold binarizations update with interpolations
 - A **?** signifies the gene is too close to the displacement between interpolated thresholds, and cannot be a guaranteed 1 or 0

2. Thresholds Tab
 - Displays a rough line graph of the gene with each threshold displayed
 - Updates line graph and thresholds when different interpolations are selected
 - Graph can be zoomed in or out with mouse scroll
 - Graph view can be moved with click and drag
 - Hover over a point to see its value
 - Hover over a line to see the threshold value
 
3. Interpolation Thresholds Tab
 - Graphs according to selected algorithms
 - Threshold line displays current interpolation's calculated threshold
 - Displays the original gene points' line
 - Hover over a point to see its value
 - Hover over a line to see its threshold value
 - Hover over a highlighted area to view the max and minimum thresholds of all interpolations

### NETWORK TAB

1. Networks Tab: Displays a possible network generated by the state table associated with each threshold of selected interpolation
2. Network State Table Tab: Displays a table of states with binarizations generated by the threshold of each algorithm on selected interpolation
3. Final Vote Tab: Displays a possible network generated by the state table associated with the final vote of each algorithm's binarization on selected interpolation
4. Final Vote State Table: Displays a table of states with binarizations associated with the final vote of each algorithm's binarization on selected interpolation
